# 3.1 WireGuard VPN Setup

This guide explains how to set up WireGuard VPN for your HomestakerOS node.
WireGuard allows you to connect your nodes via an encrypted virtual private network, providing secure remote access to your staking node while protecting sensitive validator operations from network snooping. As a modern VPN solution, WireGuard offers better performance and security than older alternatives like OpenVPN.

## Prerequisites

- A working HomestakerOS node (see [Configure and Deploy](2.2-configure_deploy.md)) - Your base system where the VPN client will run
- An existing WireGuard server or infrastructure (not covered in this guide - see WireGuard UI Services section below) - This provides the endpoint that will securely route traffic to your node

### WireGuard UI Services

If you prefer not to set up your own WireGuard server manually, several cloud providers offer WireGuard UI as a service, making the process significantly easier:

- [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/) offers simple deployment of WireGuard UI through their marketplace
- Other providers with similar offerings include DigitalOcean and Linode

You can also set up your own WireGuard UI using:
- [WireGuard UI by ngoduykhanh](https://github.com/ngoduykhanh/wireguard-ui) - A user-friendly interface for managing WireGuard configurations

These services simplify the process of generating keys, managing peers, and distributing configurations.

## Prepare the WireGuard Configuration

The following steps should be performed directly on your HomestakerOS node:

1. **Install WireGuard tools**:

   ```bash
   nix-shell -p wireguard-tools
   ```

   This will start an interactive shell with the necessary command-line tools. Use this shell to run the subsequent commands.

2. **Generate a key pair**:

   ```bash
   wg genkey | tee clientPrivateKey | wg pubkey > clientPublicKey
   ```

   This generates a cryptographically secure private key and its corresponding public key. WireGuard uses these for authenticated encryption - ensuring only authorized peers can connect to your network while protecting all traffic with strong encryption.

3. **Create and edit the WireGuard configuration file**:

   ```bash
   sudo vim /mnt/secrets/wg0.conf
   ```

   Storing the configuration in your persistent storage ensures it remains available after reboots.

Your configuration should look something like this:

```ini
[Interface]
Address = 192.168.1.120/32
PrivateKey = 0F3OWcop34EQOW+UpJnPkPCb3FKZbCY73U9T8ovo70s=

[Peer]
PublicKey = r4JYV53tLdbS/Yp50jgZpLQ0/snMtqBaFftN/Vcseh8=
AllowedIPs = 192.168.1.0/24
Endpoint = ponkila.com:51820
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

#### [Interface]

- **Address** = `<clientIP>/32`: This is the IP address assigned to your client (this node) within the VPN network.
- **PrivateKey** = `<clientPrivateKey>`: This is the private key we just generated for the WireGuard client.
This key is used to authenticate the client.

#### [Peer]

- **PublicKey** = `<serverPublicKey>`: This is the public key of the WireGuard server.
This key is used to authenticate the server.
- **AllowedIPs** = `<AllowedIPs>`: This field specifies the IP addresses or IP ranges that are allowed to be accessed through the WireGuard tunnel.
- **Endpoint** = `<serverEndpoint>:51820`: This is the IP address or hostname of the WireGuard server endpoint.
The 51820 is the default WireGuard port.
- **PersistentKeepalive** = `25`: This option ensures that the connection stays active by sending a keepalive signal every 25 seconds.

## Configure WireGuard in the Web UI

All we need to do is enable WireGuard and specify the path to the configuration file we created earlier:

1. **Access the Web UI**:
   - Start the backend and access the Web UI as described in [Accessing the Web UI](2.2-accessing_webui.md)
   - Set the flake URI and load your configurations

2. **Configure WireGuard**:
   - Go to the 'NixOS config' tab and select a node from the list
   - In the VPN section, enable WireGuard and set the configFile path to `/mnt/secrets/wg0.conf`

3. **Save and build**:
   - Save your configuration
   - Click the `#BUIDL` button to build your updated configuration
   - Download the boot media and deploy to your node

The HomestakerOS build system will automatically integrate WireGuard into your system, ensuring it starts automatically on boot and remains properly configured.

## Testing Your VPN Connection

Verifying your VPN connection ensures your node is properly secured. A misconfigured VPN could lead to connectivity issues or security vulnerabilities.

1. **Check the WireGuard interface**:

   ```bash
   sudo wg show
   ```

   This displays the active WireGuard configuration and connection status. You should see your peer listed with the correct public key.

2. **Test network connectivity**:

   ```bash
   ping 192.168.1.120  # Replace with the IP of your node on the VPN
   ```

   Run this command from another computer connected to the same VPN network. A successful ping confirms that your node is reachable through the VPN tunnel.

3. **Verify routing configuration**:

   ```bash
   ip route show
   ```

   This shows how traffic is being routed. Verify that traffic to your VPN subnet is being sent through the WireGuard interface.
