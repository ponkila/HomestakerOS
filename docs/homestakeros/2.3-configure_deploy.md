# 2.3 Configure and Deploy

This guide covers configuring your node using the HomestakerOS Web UI and deploying it to your target machine.

> **Prerequisite:** Make sure you've completed the [system preparation](2.1-prepare_system.md) steps before proceeding. You also need to have the HomestakerOS backend running and Web UI accessible as guided in the [Accessing the Web UI](2.2-accessing_webui.md).

## Basic Configuration

> **Tip:** ðŸ’¡ You can build a working and accessible system via the HomestakerOS Web UI by just setting the hostname and one authorized key.

1. **Localization**:
   - **Hostname**: Set a name for your machine (**required**)
     > This identifies your node on the network and in logs
   - **Timezone**: Set a valid timezone identifier from the [tz database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)
     > This ensures logs and timestamps are properly aligned with your local time

2. **SSH**:
   - **Authorized Keys**: Add your public SSH key(s) to enable remote access (**required**)
     > Without this, you won't be able to access your node after deployment
   - **Private Key File**: Set to `/mnt/secrets/ssh/id_ed25519`
     > This tells the system where to generate the host key, ensuring consistent identity across reboots

## Configure Storage Mounts

Now you'll need to configure HomestakerOS to mount the persistent storage you prepared earlier:

1. In the **Mounts** section, click the "+" button to create a new mount entry:

   - **Enable**: Set to `true`
   - **Name**: Give your mount a descriptive name (e.g., "PersistentStorage")
   - **Description**: Optionally add a note about the mount's purpose
   - Configure the following required fields:
     ```
     what    -> /dev/disk/by-label/homestaker
     where   -> /mnt
     type    -> ext4
     ```


2. You can leave the other mount options with their default values, which include:
   - **wantedBy**: `multi-user.target` - Ensures the filesystem mounts when the system reaches multi-user mode
   - **options**: `noatime` - Improves performance by reducing disk writes when reading files

   This configuration ensures your persistent storage is automatically mounted at boot time, making your blockchain data and secrets available to the system.

## Configure Execution Client

Choose and configure one execution client (e.g., Erigon):

1. **Enable**: Set to `true`
2. **Data Directory**: Set to `/mnt/erigon`
3. **JWT Secret File**: Set to `/mnt/secrets/jwt.hex`
4. You can leave the other options as they are by default

> **Note:** For optimal network connectivity, consider port forwarding the TCP/UDP listening port on your router, which defaults to 30303 for all execution clients. However, this is not mandatory if your router supports NAT-PMP or UPnP protocols, which can automatically handle port mapping. Enhanced connectivity improves peering with other nodes and strengthens the overall network.

## Configure Consensus Client

Choose and configure one consensus client (e.g., Lighthouse):

1. **Enable**: Set to `true`
2. **Data Directory**: Set to `/mnt/lighthouse`
3. **JWT Secret File**: Set to `/mnt/secrets/jwt.hex`
   > This must match your execution client's JWT file
4. **Execution Endpoint**: Ensure this matches your execution client's endpoint
   > This links your consensus client to the execution layer
5. You can leave the other options as they are by default

> **Note:** Just like with execution clients, consensus clients also benefit from port forwarding (default port 9000). The same NAT-PMP or UPnP alternatives apply. Better connectivity ensures your node can properly discover and communicate with the broader network.

## Build Process

1. Click the `#BUIDL` button to build your host

    The build process creates a complete, bootable system image containing your exact configuration. This can take 15-30 minutes depending on your hardware, as it compiles and packages all necessary components. Ethereum clients are particularly resource-intensive to compile due to their complexity and dependencies.

   > **Tip:** ðŸ’¡ If this is your first build, it may take longer as Nix needs to download and compile dependencies. Subsequent builds will be faster as Nix caches previously built components.

2. A list of boot media files should appear. Download each of them:

    - `kexec-boot` - Bash script used to deploy HomestakerOS
    - `initrd.zst` - Compressed initial ramdisk containing your system
    - `bzImage` - The Linux kernel

    These files contain everything needed to boot your custom HomestakerOS image. Additionally, `nixConfig.tar` contains your NixOS configurations for Git-based management covered in later documentation.

3. **Transfer the files to the target machine**:

    Using rsync:
    ```bash
    rsync -avz kexec-boot initrd.zst bzImage core@target_ip:/home/core/
    ```

    Using scp:
    ```bash
    scp kexec-boot initrd.zst bzImage core@target_ip:/home/core
    ```

    > **Note:** Replace `target_ip` with your machine's IP address. The default username in HomestakerOS systems is `core`.


## Deployment

> **Note:** The following steps should be performed on your target machine.

1. **Install kexec-tools**:

   ```bash
   apt-get install kexec-tools
   ```

   The kexec utility allows Linux to boot directly into another kernel without a full reboot, making deployment faster and more reliable.

2. **Make the boot script executable**:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x kexec-boot
   ```

3. **Execute**:

   ```bash
   sudo ./kexec-boot
   ```

   This script loads your custom HomestakerOS kernel and initramfs into memory and boots into it.

## After Deployment

> **Important:** HomestakerOS runs entirely in RAM, which means user-generated directories and files will not persist across reboots.
All persistent data should be stored in the mounted filesystem(s).

After your system boots into HomestakerOS, you can:

- Connect to your node via SSH using the keys you configured:
  ```bash
  ssh core@target_ip
  ```

- Check that your clients are running correctly:
  ```bash
  systemctl status <client-name>.service
  ```

- Monitor logs for the clients:
  ```bash
  journalctl -fu <client-name>.service
  ```

## Next Steps

After successfully deploying your node, you may want to:

- [Manage your configurations with Git](2.4-git_management.md) for version control
- Set up advanced features like [WireGuard VPN](3.1-wireguard_vpn.md) for secure remote access
- Add [SSV Node](3.2-ssv_node.md) for distributed validator technology
- Consult the [Reference](4-reference.md) for detailed configuration options
