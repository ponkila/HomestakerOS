# 2.2 Accessing the Web UI

This guide covers setting up your environment to run the HomestakerOS backend, and how to access the Web UI. Unlike the system preparation steps, this part can be done on any computer which can access homestakeros.com through a web browser and has decent hardware resources as it will be compiling the boot media.

> **Prerequisite:** If you are setting up HomestakerOS right now, make sure you've completed the [system preparation](2.1-prepare_system.md) steps before proceeding.

## Setting Up the Environment

1. **Install required dependecies** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl git
   ```

2. **Install Nix** following the instructions at [nixos.org](https://nixos.org/download.html):

   ```bash
   sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
   ```

   This installs the Nix package manager; it provides the reproducible build environment for HomestakerOS backend.

3. **Allow Nix Flakes and nix-command by default** (optional):

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/nix
   echo 'experimental-features = nix-command flakes' >> ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
   ```

   Without this configuration, you would need to add `--experimental-features 'nix-command flakes'` to almost every Nix command you run.

## Accessing the Web UI

1. **Clone the HomestakerOS repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ponkila/HomestakerOS && cd HomestakerOS
   ```

   This downloads the HomestakerOS codebase, which contains all the necessary components to build and configure your node.

2. **Launch the backend service**:

   ```bash
   nix run .#backend --accept-flake-config
   ```

   This command starts the backend service that powers the web interface and handles the actual configuration generation.

3. **Go to**: [https://homestakeros.com/](https://homestakeros.com/)
    - Set the flake URI (or use the default `ponkila/homestaking-infra`)
    - Click 'Submit' and go to the 'NixOS config' tab
    - Create a 'new node template' from the dropdown menu

   The web interface provides a user-friendly way to configure complex NixOS settings without needing to write Nix code directly.

## Next Steps

After successfully accessing the Web UI, proceed to:
