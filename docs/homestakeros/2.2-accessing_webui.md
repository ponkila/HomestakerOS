# 2.2 Accessing the Web UI

This guide covers setting up your environment to access the HomestakerOS Web UI, which is essential for configuring your node.

> **Prerequisite:** If you are setting up HomestakerOS right now, make sure you've completed the [system preparation](2.1-prepare_system.md) steps before proceeding.

## Setting Up the Environment

1. **Install Nix** following the instructions at [nixos.org](https://nixos.org/download.html):

   ```bash
   sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
   ```

  This installs the Nix package manager; it provides the reproducible build environment for HomestakerOS backend.

2. **Allow Nix Flakes and nix-command by default** (optional):

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/nix
   echo 'experimental-features = nix-command flakes' >> ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
   ```

   Without this configuration, you would need to add `--experimental-features 'nix-command flakes'` to almost every Nix command you run.

3. **Install the nix-command**:

   ```bash
   nix-env -iA nixpkgs.nix
   ```

   This installs the latest version of Nix, which is required to run the HomestakerOS backend.

## Accessing the Web UI

1. **Clone the HomestakerOS repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ponkila/HomestakerOS && cd HomestakerOS
   ```

   This downloads the HomestakerOS codebase, which contains all the necessary components to build and configure your node.

2. **Launch the backend service**:

   ```bash
   nix run .#backend
   ```

   This command starts the backend service that powers the web interface and handles the actual configuration generation.

3. **Go to: [https://homestakeros.com/](https://homestakeros.com/)
    - Set the flake URI (or use the default `ponkila/homestaking-infra`)
    - Click 'Submit' and go to the 'NixOS config' tab
    - Create a 'new node template' from the dropdown menu

   The web interface provides a user-friendly way to configure complex NixOS settings without needing to write Nix code directly.

## Next Steps

After successfully accessing the Web UI, proceed to:
