# 3.2 SSV Node Setup

This guide explains how to set up an SSV (Secret Shared Validator) node with HomestakerOS.
The [ssv.network](https://ssv.network/overview/) is a fully decentralized, open-source, and trustless DVT Network that provides infrastructure for decentralizing Ethereum validators.

Running an SSV node allows you to participate in distributed validator technology, which increases Ethereum's decentralization and resilience by distributing validator operations across multiple operators. This approach reduces single points of failure and improves the overall security of the Ethereum network.

## Prerequisites

- A working HomestakerOS node (see [Configure and Deploy](2.3-configure_deploy.md))
- Some ETH and SSV tokens for operator registration and maintenance (SSV tokens are required for network participation and compensation)
- MetaMask wallet for operator registration (required for on-chain transactions)

> **Tip:** ðŸ’¡ Alternatively, for operator keys generation and registration, you can follow the [SSV Network Instructions](https://ssv-network.gitbook.io/guides/operator/registering-an-operator).

## Generate SSV Operator Keys

> **Note:** The commands in this section require root privileges. Before proceeding, switch to the root user by running: `sudo su`

The following steps should be performed directly on your HomestakerOS node:

1. **Create the SSV directory**:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p /mnt/addons/ssv
   cd /mnt/addons/ssv
   ```

   Creating a dedicated directory keeps your SSV node configuration files organized and separate from other components.

2. **Generate a key pair**:

   ```bash
   nix run github:ponkila/HomestakerOS#init-ssv --accept-flake-config -- <MY_OPERATOR_PASSWORD>
   ```

   This command will generate three files: a `password` file containing your password, an encrypted private key in `ssv_operator_key`, and a public key in `ssv_operator_key.pub`. You'll need the public key for registration.

   The key pair is essential for the secure operation of your SSV node. The private key must be kept secure and will be used to sign messages, while the public key identifies your operator on the network.

## Register as an SSV Operator

You need to register your SSV node as an operator on the SSV network.
Registration is required to make your node discoverable on the SSV network and to receive payment for your services.
You can do this directly through the HomestakerOS Web UI:

1. **Access the Web UI**:
   - Start the backend and access the Web UI as described in [Accessing the Web UI](2.2-accessing_webui.md)
   - Set the flake URI and load your configurations

2. **Navigate to the SSV registration page**:
   - Connect to your MetaMask account
   - Select the network in MetaMask
   - Enter the public operator key we generated earlier
   - Enter the [daily fee](https://docs.ssv.network/learn/protocol-overview/tokenomics/fees/)
   - Choose whether the operator will be private or public
   - Click the 'Register' button
   - Confirm the transaction in MetaMask
        > The transaction permanently associates your public key with your Ethereum address on the blockchain.

3. **Verify registration**:
   - A transaction link will appear in the UI
   - Once the transaction is completed, the new operator will appear on SSV.Network

## Network Configuration

For your SSV node to function properly on the network, it needs to communicate with other nodes. For optimal network connectivity, consider port forwarding TCP port 13001 and UDP port 12001 on your router. However, this is not mandatory if your router supports NAT-PMP or UPnP protocols, which can automatically handle port mapping. Proper network connectivity ensures your SSV node can communicate effectively with the network and participate in its duties.

## Re-Configure SSV Node in the Web UI

> **Important**: If you stored the files exactly at the same paths as the defaults, which are:
> - dataDir: `/mnt/addons/ssv`
> - privateKeyFile: `/mnt/addons/ssv/ssv_operator_key`
> - privateKeyPasswordFile: `/mnt/addons/ssv/password`
>
> You do not need to re-configure nor rebuild. SSV-node is integrated into HomestakerOS by default and will start automatically when the keys are present (checked at 10-minute intervals). Skip to the "Verifying Your SSV Node" section.

Now that your operator is registered, configure your SSV node:

1. **Access the configuration tab**:
   - Go to the 'NixOS config' tab
   - Select your node from the list or create a new one

2. **Configure SSV-Node**:
   - In the Add-ons section, find SSV-Node
   - Set `dataDir` to the directory where SSV node will store its operational data
   - Set `privateKeyFile` to path to your encrypted private key
   - Set `privateKeyPasswordFile` to path to your password file

3. **Save and build**:
   - Click the 'Save' button
   - Click the `#BUIDL` button to build your updated configuration
   - Download the boot media and deploy to your node

The build updates the SSV node paths in your HomestakerOS image, configuring it to start automatically on boot.

## Verifying Your SSV Node

After deployment, verify that your SSV node is running correctly:

1. **Check the service status**:

   ```bash
   systemctl status ssv-autostart.service
   ```

   This confirms that the service is properly running without errors.

2. **View the logs**:

   ```bash
   journalctl -fu ssv-autostart.service
   ```

   This command displays real-time logs for the SSV service, helping you monitor its operation and troubleshoot any issues.

3. **Check operator performance**:
   - Return to the SSV Explorer and find your operator
   - Verify that it shows as active and is performing duties

Monitoring performance ensures you're fulfilling your obligations and will receive compensation for your services.
