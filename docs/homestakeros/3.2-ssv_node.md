# 3.2 SSV Node Setup

This guide explains how to set up an SSV (Secret Shared Validator) node with HomestakerOS.
The [ssv.network](https://ssv.network/overview/) is a fully decentralized, open-source, and trustless DVT Network that provides infrastructure for decentralizing Ethereum validators.

Running an SSV node allows you to participate in distributed validator technology, which increases Ethereum's decentralization and resilience by distributing validator operations across multiple operators. This approach reduces single points of failure and improves the overall security of the Ethereum network.

## Prerequisites

- A working HomestakerOS node (see [Configure and Deploy](2.2-configure_deploy.md))
- Some ETH and SSV tokens for operator registration and maintenance (SSV tokens are required for network participation and compensation)
- MetaMask wallet for operator registration (required for on-chain transactions)

> **Tip:** ðŸ’¡ Alternatively, for operator keys generation and registration, you can follow the [SSV Network Instructions](https://ssv-network.gitbook.io/guides/operator/registering-an-operator).

## Generate SSV Operator Keys

The following steps should be performed directly on your HomestakerOS node:

1. **Create the SSV directory**:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p /mnt/nvme/addons/ssv
   cd /mnt/nvme/addons/ssv
   ```

   Creating a dedicated directory keeps your SSV node configuration files organized and separate from other components.

2. **Generate a key pair**:

   ```bash
   nix run github:ponkila/HomestakerOS#init-ssv -- <MY_OPERATOR_PASSWORD>
   ```

This command will generate three files: a `password` file containing your password, an encrypted private key in `ssv_operator_key`, and a `public key in`ssv_operator_key.pub`. You'll need the public key for registration.

The key pair is essential for the secure operation of your SSV node. The private key must be kept secure and will be used to sign messages, while the public key identifies your operator on the network.

## Register as an SSV Operator

You need to register your SSV node as an operator on the SSV network.
Registration is required to make your node discoverable on the SSV network and to receive payment for your services.
You can do this directly through the HomestakerOS Web UI:

1. **Access the Web UI**:
   - Start the backend and go to [https://homestakeros.com/](https://homestakeros.com/)
   - Set the flake URI and load your configurations

2. **Navigate to the SSV registration page**:
   - Connect to your MetaMask account
   - Select the network in MetaMask
   - Enter the public operator key
   - Enter the daily fee
   - Choose whether the operator will be private or public
   - Click the 'Register' button
   - Confirm the transaction in MetaMask
        > The transaction permanently associates your public key with your Ethereum address on the blockchain.

3. **Verify registration**:
   - A transaction link will appear in the UI
   - Once the transaction is completed, the new operator will appear on SSV.Network

## Configure SSV Node in the Web UI

Now that your operator is registered, configure your SSV node:

1. **Access the configuration tab**:
   - Go to the 'NixOS config' tab
   - Select your node from the list or create a new one

2. **Configure SSV-Node**:
   - In the Add-ons section, find SSV-Node
   - Set `dataDir` to `/mnt/nvme/addons/ssv`
   - Set `privateKeyFile` to path to your encrypted private key, in this case `/mnt/nvme/addons/ssv/ssv_operator_key`
   - Set `privateKeyPasswordFile` to path to your password file, in this case `/mnt/nvme/addons/ssv/password`
   - Set any additional options as needed

3. **Save and build**:
   - Click the 'Save' button
   - Click the `#BUIDL` button to build your updated configuration
   - Download the boot media and deploy to your node

   The build process integrates the SSV node into your HomestakerOS image, configuring it to start automatically on boot.

## Verifying Your SSV Node

After deployment, verify that your SSV node is running correctly:

1. **Check the service status**:

   ```bash
   systemctl status ssv-node.service
   ```

   This confirms that the service is properly running without errors.

2. **View the logs**:

   ```bash
   journalctl -fu ssv-node.service
   ```

   Logs provide detailed information about your node's operation and can help diagnose any issues.

3. **Check operator performance**:
   - Return to the SSV Explorer and find your operator
   - Verify that it shows as active and is performing duties

   Monitoring performance ensures you're fulfilling your obligations and will receive compensation for your services.
