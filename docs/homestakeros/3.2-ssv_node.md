# 3.2 SSV Node Setup

This guide explains how to set up an SSV (Secret Shared Validator) node with HomestakerOS.
The [ssv.network](https://ssv.network/overview/) is a fully decentralized, open-source, and trustless DVT Network that provides infrastructure for decentralizing Ethereum validators.

Running an SSV node allows you to participate in distributed validator technology, which increases Ethereum's decentralization and resilience by distributing validator operations across multiple operators. This approach reduces single points of failure and improves the overall security of the Ethereum network.

## Prerequisites

- A working HomestakerOS node (see [Configure and Deploy](2.3-configure_deploy.md))
- Some ETH and SSV tokens for operator registration and maintenance (SSV tokens are required for network participation and compensation)
- MetaMask wallet for operator registration (required for on-chain transactions)

> **Tip:** ðŸ’¡ Alternatively, for operator keys generation and registration, you can follow the [SSV Network Instructions](https://ssv-network.gitbook.io/guides/operator/registering-an-operator).

## Fetch SSV Operator Public Key

> **Note:** The SSV node is integrated into HomestakerOS by default and does not require explicit enabling. It automatically generates the operator keys if the dataDir is a persistent location and the node will activate once your operator is properly registered on the SSV network.

1. **Locate the SSV data directory**:

   HomestakerOS automatically determines where to store SSV data:
   - If you have configured mounts, it uses the first available mount point: `<first-mount-point>/ssv`
   - If no mounts are configured, it defaults to `/mnt/addons/ssv`

     > **Tip:** If this default path is not suitable for your setup:
     > - Access the Web UI and navigate to the 'NixOS config' tab
     > - In the Add-ons section, find SSV-Node and re-configure the `dataDir` path
     > - Rebuild and deploy the update to your node to generate the keys at your preferred location
     > - Remove any automatically generated files at the old location

2. **Retrieve your public key**:

   ```bash
   cat /path/to/ssv_operator_key.pub
   ```

   This public key is essential for the operator registration process in the next section. Make sure to copy it exactly as shown.

## Register as an SSV Operator

You need to register your SSV node as an operator on the SSV network.
Registration is required to make your node discoverable on the SSV network and to receive payment for your services.
You can do this directly through the HomestakerOS Web UI:

1. **Access the Web UI**:
   - Start the backend and access the Web UI as described in [Accessing the Web UI](2.2-accessing_webui.md)
   - Set the flake URI and load your configurations

2. **Navigate to the SSV registration page**:
   - Connect to your MetaMask account
   - Select the network in MetaMask
   - Enter the public operator key we generated earlier
   - Enter the [daily fee](https://docs.ssv.network/learn/protocol-overview/tokenomics/fees/)
   - Choose whether the operator will be private or public
   - Click the 'Register' button
   - Confirm the transaction in MetaMask
        > The transaction permanently associates your public key with your Ethereum address on the blockchain.

3. **Wait for confirmation**:
   - A transaction link will appear in the UI
   - Once the transaction is completed, the new operator will appear on SSV.Network

## Network Configuration

For your SSV node to function properly on the network, it needs to communicate with other nodes. For optimal network connectivity, consider port forwarding TCP port 13001 and UDP port 12001 on your router. However, this is not mandatory if your router supports NAT-PMP or UPnP protocols, which can automatically handle port mapping. Proper network connectivity ensures your SSV node can communicate effectively with the network and participate in its duties.

## Verifying Your SSV Node

After deployment, verify that your SSV node is running correctly:

1. **Verify operator registration**:

   ```bash
   curl -s https://api.ssv.network/api/v4/mainnet/operators/public_key/<your_public_key>
   ```

   A registered operator will show complete details in the response

2. **Check the service status**:

   ```bash
   systemctl status ssv-autostart.service
   ```

   This confirms that the service is properly running without errors.

3. **View the logs**:

   ```bash
   journalctl -fu ssv-autostart.service
   ```

   This command displays real-time logs for the SSV service, helping you monitor its operation and troubleshoot any issues.

4. **Check operator performance**:
   - Return to the SSV Explorer and find your operator
   - Verify that it shows as active and is performing duties

Monitoring performance ensures you're fulfilling your obligations and will receive compensation for your services.
