# 2.4 Managing Your Configurations with Git

This guide explains how to set up and maintain a Git repository for your HomestakerOS configurations, allowing you to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with others.

## Setting Up Your Git Repository

### Create Your Repository from the Template

1. Navigate to the [ponkila/HomestakerOS-template](https://github.com/ponkila/HomestakerOS-template) repository
2. Click the 'Use this template' button to create your own repository
3. Name your repository something descriptive (e.g., `homestaking-infra`)

> **Note:** Your repository has to be public to be able to load the configurations in the HomestakerOS Web UI.

### Clone Your Repository Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repository-name>.git
cd <your-repository-name>
```
This creates a local copy of your repository that you can work with.

### Connect Your Repository to HomestakerOS

1. Access the Web UI as described in [Accessing the Web UI](2.2-accessing_webui.md)
2. In the starting page, set the flake URI as: `<github-username>/<repository-name>`
3. Click 'Submit' to load your configurations

## Working with Your Configuration

The template repository comes with a basic structure that HomestakerOS expects:

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ flake.lock
â”œâ”€â”€ flake.nix
â”œâ”€â”€ nixosConfigurations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ foobar
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ default.json
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ default.nix
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ hostnames.json
â””â”€â”€ nixosModules
    â””â”€â”€ homestakeros
        â””â”€â”€ options.json
```

When you generate configurations through the Web UI, they will be organized in this structure.

### Making Changes Through the Web UI

1. Navigate to the 'NixOS config' tab
2. Select the node you want to modify from the list
3. Make your desired configuration changes
4. Click the `#BUIDL` button to generate the updated configuration

### Updating Your Git Repository

When you build a node through the Web UI, HomestakerOS generates a `nixConfig.tar` file containing the complete configuration for your node.

To update your repository with these changes:

1. Download the `nixConfig.tar` file from the Web UI

2. Extract the configuration files to your local repository:

   ```bash
   tar -xf nixConfig.tar -C /path/to/your/local/repo
   ```

3. Review the changes:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/local/repo
   git status
   git diff
   ```
  This shows what files have been added or modified.

4. Commit and push your changes:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/local/repo
   git add .
   git commit -m "Updated node configuration"
   git push
   ```

   > **Tip**: ðŸ’¡ Use meaningful commit messages that describe what you changed and why. This helps you understand the purpose of changes when reviewing your configuration history.

## Next Steps

Now that you have your configurations in Git, consider:

- Setting up [WireGuard VPN](3.1-wireguard_vpn.md) for secure remote access
- Configuring an [SSV Node](3.2-ssv_node.md) for distributed validation
- Exploring the [Reference](4-reference.md) for detailed configuration options
