# 2.3 Managing Your Configurations with Git

This guide explains how to set up and maintain a Git repository for your HomestakerOS configurations, allowing you to track changes and collaborate with others.

## Use the HomestakerOS Template

> **Tip:** ðŸ’¡ Using version control for your configurations makes it easy to revert changes and share your setup with others.

1. Go to the [ponkila/HomestakerOS-template](https://github.com/ponkila/HomestakerOS-template) repository
2. Click 'Use this template' to create your own repository
3. Name it something descriptive like `my-homestaking-infra`

## Reference Your Repository in the Web UI

1. Start the backend and go to [https://homestakeros.com/](https://homestakeros.com/)
2. Set the flake URI as `<github-username>/<repository-name>`
3. Click 'Submit' to load your configurations

## Make Changes to Your Configuration

1. Go to the 'NixOS config' tab and select a node from the list
2. Make your desired changes through the Web UI
3. Click `#BUIDL` to build the updated configuration

## Update Your Repository

When you build a node through the HomestakerOS Web UI, the backend generates a `nixConfig.tar` file containing the complete NixOS configuration for your node.

You can use this to update your repository:

1. Download the `nixConfig.tar` file from the Web UI

2. Extract the configuration files:

   ```bash
   tar -xf nixConfig.tar -C /path/to/your/local/repo
   ```

3. Commit and push the changes:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/local/repo
   git add .
   git commit -m "Updated node configuration"
   git push
   ```

## Next Steps

Now that you have your configurations in Git:

- Set up [WireGuard VPN](3.1-wireguard_vpn.md) for secure remote access to your node
- Configure an [SSV Node](3.2-ssv_node.md) if you're interested in distributed validation
- Refer to the [Reference](4-reference.md) for detailed configuration options
